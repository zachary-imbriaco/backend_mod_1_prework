## Section 2 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?

I feel like I give myself ample time to figure things out on my own, before reaching out for help.

### If Statements

1. What is a conditional statement? Give three examples.
  - A conditional statement is a condition that determines whether code assigned to it runs, and evaluates as either true or false.
  - Ex1: if pizza == tasty
  - Ex2: if i == "god" || truth == "relative"
  - Ex3: if pigs_fly == true && hell_frozen_over == true

1. Why might you want to use an if-statement?
  - You want a specific variable to be checked to determine what code to run.

1. What is the Ruby syntax for an if statement?
  - ```
  if [conditional]
    [code]
  [end]
  ```

1. How do you add multiple conditions to an if statement?
  - Using elsif and else conditionals.

1. Provide an example of the Ruby syntax for an if/elsif/else statement:
  - ```
    if [conditional]
      [code]
    elsif [conditional]
      [code]
    else
      [code]
    end
    ```

1. Other than an if-statement, can you think of any other ways we might want to use a conditional statement?
  - For ensuring we run specific blocks of code under specific situations.

### Methods

1. In your own words, what is the purpose of a method?
  - The purpose of a method is to provide a reusable block of code that can be called back easily.

1. Create a method named `hello` that will print `"Sam I am"`.

1. Create a method named `hello_someone` that takes an argument of `name` and prints `"#{name} I am"`.

1. How would you call or execute the method that you created above?

1. What questions do you have about methods in Ruby?
