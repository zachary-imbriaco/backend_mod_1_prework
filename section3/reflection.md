## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?
  - The importance of self-reflection on your coding, as well as learning about ZPD.
1. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?
  - Wanting to practice and improve my skills in various aspects of coding.  I don't in that I struggle with setting SMART goals compared to larger-scale objectives.
1. What is a Hash, and how is it different from an Array?
  - A hash is an object containing a series of key/value pairs, while an array only contains indexed values.
1. In the space below, create a Hash stored to a variable named `pet_store`.  This hash should hold an inventory of items and the number of that item that you might find at a pet store.
  - ```
    pet_store = {
      pet_food: 200,
      toys: 150,
      collars: 175
    }
  ```
1. Given the following `states = {"CO" => "Colorado", "IA" => "Iowa", "OK" => "Oklahoma"}`, how would you access the value `"Iowa"`?
  - ```
    states['IA']
  ```
1. With the same hash above, how would we get all the keys?  How about all the values?
  - ```
    states.keys
    states.values
  ```
1. What is another example of when we might use a hash?  In your example, why is a hash better than an array?
  - We might use a hash when we need to contain various information about a specific item, like an image or an email.  A hash isn't better than an array, they just serve different purposes.  An array is better when you don't need to assign specific keys to specific values, while a hash works when you need to standardize sets of data.
1. What questions do you still have about hashes?
  - N/A.
